# forkify

<ul>
  <li>The Forkify app is a recipe app that allows users to search for and view recipes from an API.</li>
  <li>The app is built using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, which separates the app's data, logic, and presentation into separate components. This makes the app easier to maintain and update over time.</li>
  <li>The app is bundled using Parcel, a web application bundler that helps optimize the app's performance and speed up development time.</li>
  <li>When the app loads, it fetches recipe data from the API and renders it on the screen.</li>
  <li>Users can search for recipes by entering keywords in the search bar.</li>
  <li>The app also allows users to bookmark recipes and save them to a list. This list is saved in the user's local storage and can be accessed even after the user closes the app.</li>
  <li>Users can also upload their own recipes to the app. These recipes are only visible to the user who uploaded them and are not shared with other users.</li>
  <li>Overall, the Forkify app is a user-friendly and customizable recipe app that allows users to easily find and save their favorite recipes.</li>
